# Find the shortest path
In this project we try to find the shortest path from one router to another by finding routing table of each router.
There are many algorithms for finding a solution, and we used Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms. The code we implemented generate a random direct graph. We choose it to be directed graph because our router is connected with other routers in one way so, each router connects with maximum 5 routers and sometimes other routers are not connected to each other so, in some examination we donâ€™t have paths and some we have direct paths.
